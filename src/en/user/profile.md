As a user of TheGreesShot application, your first action will be to complete your user profile in order to provide the legal information necessary to integrate projects.

To do this, you must go to the My Profile page available in the left side navigation menu or the menu button on the top banner of your smartphone.

The My Profile page is a form that is divided into four distinct sections:

- the form for editing your personal data
- the form for editing your full address
- the form for changing your personal password
- the list of contracts associated with you. If you have just joined the project, you will see the contract proposal made by the project manager. You will receive your contract and can sign it when your profile data has been completed.
