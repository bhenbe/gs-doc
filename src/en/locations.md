As an administrator associated with a project, you have the option of adding filming locations for your team via the Places page available in the left side navigation menu or the menu button in the top banner of your smartphone.

This page is in the form of a list of available locations. Each line in the list is clickable to bring up more information as well as editing options.

Each location offers several addresses adapted to your departments in order to facilitate the use of the locations.
