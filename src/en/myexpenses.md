As a user associated with a project, you will have to specify your expenses via the My Expenses page available in the left side navigation menu or the menu button in the top banner of your smartphone.

This page is in the form of a list of your unsubmitted expenses. When they are submitted, they are subject to verification by your administrator and you can check the status of each Charge via the second tab of this Sent Charge Sheet page, Status column.

The following statuses may appear:

- submitted:
- validated hod: (validated head of service / department)
- refuse:
- validated: (production)

In order to more easily find the information you are looking for, you can sort the list according to four criteria: the identifier, the status, the type of expense and the date of addition of the specified expense. This sorting is done by clicking on the title of a column in the list.

Add a new expense
In the upper right corner of your screen is a Createâ€¦ button. Clicking on it displays a drop-down menu with additional options:

- Journey
- Ticket
- Invoice

Your choice brings up a window that presents the expense addition form. This form differs depending on the type of option you have chosen.

As part of a trip, you will be asked to specify it and your type of trip.
As part of a ticket, you will be prompted to specify where the purchase was made, its context, and a photocopy of the ticket.
As part of a purchase invoice, you will be prompted to submit the invoice.

The list of your costs remains available in tabular form. Each line can be clicked to display the complete information and you can also send it back by e-mail using the button provided for this purpose.
When you have finished editing and modifying your charges, you must send them to your manager for validation. TheGreenShot will create an expense sheet with all of the expenses to be sent. You will no longer be able to modify these costs unless they are refused by your manager in the first validation or by your production manager in the second validation.
