You can view the contracts associated with you on the My Documents page available in the left side navigation menu or the menu button in the top banner of your smartphone.
Your contract includes certain data from your profile (surname, first name, address, etc.) that you must therefore complete before signing it

The My Documents page is divided into two distinct sections:

- the preview frame of the document selected in the following list
- a list of all the documents shared with you; these documents can be of several types (contract, scenario, etc.)

As a user, you can view and download these documents.

The list view allows you to know the person who shared this document with you and the date on which it was added.

Eventually, you will have a long list of documents. A text zone is provided for this purpose in order to filter the contents of the list and thus allow you to search for a document by its name. You also have the possibility, by clicking on the title of a column in the list, to sort all the documents on the basis of the criterion in question (for example: sort the list by date added or by issuer).
