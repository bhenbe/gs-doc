As an administrator associated with a project, you will be required to validate your team's purchase orders via the Validate POs page available in the left side navigation menu or the menu button in the top banner of your smartphone.

This page is presented in the form of a list of the purchase orders submitted, grouped by departments and by people. Each order form is clickable to provide more information as well as additional moderation options.

The moderation options are as follows:

- validate the order
- refuse the order

You can also find a notification of the number of purchase orders to be validated in the top right-hand banner of the application.
