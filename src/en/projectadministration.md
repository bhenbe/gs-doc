As a producer, you can configure your projects via the Configuration> Project page available in the left side navigation menu or the menu button in the top banner of your smartphone.

The configuration of your project is divided into four distinct tabs, each with a specific form to manage all the data useful for your project.

## Project options
Project options are descriptive and useful information. It contains the presentation elements of the project, the important stakeholders as well as important information such as the currency and other calculation rules.

## Departments and functions
This tab allows you to organize your team according to the structure that your project requires. You can add as many departments and functions as needed

## Budget categories
This tab allows you to specify the budget rules by department, useful for the calculations of the various expenses that your team will submit to you later. You can also, for each category configured, define the initial budget that you allocate to this category. These are either categories related to expenses, for example: meals for the "Decorator" department
or salary categories for each function, for example salary for employees of the "production assistant" function.

## Contract agreement templates
This tab allows you to pre-create your contract models submitted to future members of your team. You can create contracts in word or pdf format with fields to fill in corresponding to your employees' data (name, address, etc.). TheGreenShot will automatically generate the content based on employee data.
You can also request that the employee electronically sign the contract. TheGreenShot offers an electronic signature system integrated into the application.
