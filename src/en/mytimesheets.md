As a user associated with a project, you will have to specify your working time via the My Timesheets page available in the left side navigation menu or the menu button in the top banner of your smartphone.

This page is in the form of a list of your submitted benefits. These are subject to verification by your administrator and you can check the status of each Timesheet through the Status column of that list.

The following statuses may appear:

- submitted:
- not transmitted:
- validated hod:
- refuse:
- validated:

In order to more easily find the information you are looking for, you can sort the list according to two criteria: the status and the start date of the specified working time. This sorting is done by clicking on the title of a column in the list.

## Add a new working time
In the upper right corner of your screen is an Add Hours button. By clicking on it, you will be redirected to a new page, My Work, also available in the left side navigation menu or the menu button on the top banner of your smartphone.

This page is divided into two distinct parts:

- the form for adding working time
- the list of working hours not yet submitted for validation

The form for adding working time has several options:

- the calendar for selecting the date of the day for which you have worked hours; This field is required
- the type of tariff
- the duration of your service, either by specifying a start time and an end time or by specifying a full working day according to your contract. You can only add services for the days included between the start and end date of your contract.
- the duration of your lunch break, either by specifying a start time and an end time or by specifying the legal time for the lunch break according to your contract
- whether or not you are staying at the hotel for the duration of your encoded services
- the button to add this service to your timesheet; this button does not automatically submit your timesheet for validation but adds it to the list of services submitted to us; you will be able to submit a set of services at once
- The services are assembled automatically in weekly "timesheets" from Monday to Sunday.

The list of your services remains available under the form. You can always edit them or even delete the wrong lines.
Then, when you have finished your edits and modifications, you can send your timesheets for validation to your head of department. After sending your data, you will not be able to modify them unless they come back refused by your head of department.
