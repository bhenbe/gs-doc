As an administrator associated with a project, you will have to validate the services of your team via the Validate work page available in the left side navigation menu or the menu button in the top banner of your smartphone.

This page is in the form of a list of services submitted, grouped by person. Each service can be clicked to provide more information as well as additional moderation options.

The moderation options are as follows:

- validate the timesheet
- send the timesheet by e-mail
- reject the timesheet

You can find a notification of the number of services to be validated in the top right-hand banner of the application. To reject part of the timesheet, click on it to display the detail. In this window you will be able to reject the hours submitted day by day.
