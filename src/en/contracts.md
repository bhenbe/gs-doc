When you associate a department and a function with a user during the invitation or when the latter is part of the project, TheGreenShot offers you to complete the working conditions and payment in the contract. When you have finished filling out the contract, you can save it as a "template" for this department and this function. 

When you re-choose this same department and function later, TheGreenShot will offer you the content of this "template" automatically. You can of course modify it before saving it.
